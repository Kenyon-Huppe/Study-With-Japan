A dummy brochure site showcasing web development aptitude. The Study With Japan site presents an option for students looking to study culture in Japan.

Description: This site allos the user to browse different tiers of purchasing options for studing Japanese culture in Japan. Along with this, Study With Japan also features an 
discover page that allows the user to browse different icons of the Japanese culture. The landing page presents a welcoming banner image along with an about page below. 
In the footer of each page lies a collection of different links to Study With Japan's various social media platform accounts.

Project Overview: This was one of my first actual projects, & one that means a lot to me. I have a great passion for Japanese culture, so as you can imagine, this project was 
made with a lot of love & care. While I didn't have much JavaScript knowledge at the time of starting this project, I was able to grasp the DOM quite well by the end of it. The JS, while minimal, is used to allow the nav bar to function. My primary focus when making this site was to really build & cement my skills with CSS which I very much feel I 
accomplished. By far the home page took the most time. I believe this is due to it being the most complex of the three, my skills drastically improving in conjunction
while making it, as well as several element (the header & footer) being re-used on the other pages.
